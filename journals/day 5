Planning my workshop space. I'll need about a quarter million dollars to fund the kind of
lab I'm thinking about, another half million dollars for a basic particle accelerator
Due to the rate of palladiums hydrogen capacity, I estimate it may be possible
to achieve cold fusion by slamming a super fast hydrogen at the already compressed hydrogen
stored in the palladium molecules. This can be modeled using coulumbs law to determine
just how fast and how compressed the hydrogen has to be

lab space: 60 feet X 40 feet

which is equal to about 2400 square feet, or in a more easy way to look at it 0.0551 of an acre, which is honestly not a lot of land

so maybe I can up the lab space just a bit
