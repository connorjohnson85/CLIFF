Today I got an idea for another form of energy than a cold fusion reactor

using magnetic induction, i'd like to build a perpetual magnet, similar to how the magnetic containment chamber in a tokamok reactor worksâ‰¥
a torus within which a magnet can constantly be moving around, without accelerating, flying through multiple coils, generating a change in magnetics,
therefore producing energy. The kinetic energy would be provided by the magnet, which would be in "orbit" around the center of the torus 

sketch for this idea is in sketch1
