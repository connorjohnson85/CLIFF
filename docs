C.L.I.F.F. is a python application I created to serve as a couple different purposes
One is that it is my main portfolio project, showcasing technologies that I have learned
I.E Flask, machine learning using sklearn and numpy, SQLAlchemy, and other technologies
Another is to act as my "Home Assitant" with the ability to send gmails, set reminders, and eventually do such things as play music
