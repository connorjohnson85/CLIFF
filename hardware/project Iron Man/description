Each folder represents a subSystem of the Iron Man Armor
And a so called impossible engineering problem of the world today

ARC REACTOR: Power. A mini Fusion Reactor. No one has ever made even a big version of this thing

CONTROL: EEG. Iron man controls the suit with his mind. I don't think this is possible without a intrusive surgery, due to the skull. So instead I think I'll set up sensors that sense the way my arms are moving and move to assist them

Delivery: How to segmentize the entire suit and allow it to be delivered like the Mark 42

Flight Systems: How to Move It effiecently using clean energy

Heat Dispersion: How to disperse the heat from sticking a ginomours reactor near my body and prevent it from frying me like a egg in boiling water

HUD: Easiest part. An AR system that can read stuff

Inertial Systems: Well this one is basically disobeying the law of physics. Break inertia so that I can perform crazy stunts

Repulsor Systems: None lethal concussive bursts.
