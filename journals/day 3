Decided to try and figure out cold fusion. reasoning is that without cold fusion, I'd have to heat up something near me to plasmifyied temperature...
45000 degrees Fahrenheit... hotter than the earths core... which would be pretty much asking to die. That would be very hard not to kill me
So I need to figure out something that doesn't use hot fusion and uses some other type of reactor. I suspect there might be a way 
to use palladiums absorbsition properties to activate cold fusion, however experiments will have to be conducted... which will definitly 
be very expensive.
