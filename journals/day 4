starting working on understanding more about quantum mechanics
Going to have to spend a lot of time in this area
Looked into the properties of palladium, intriguing about its rate of hydrogen capture
Starting to research more in depth about the various properties of particle physics. Will store all information 
I learn in a notes section.
