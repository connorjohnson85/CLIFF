Essential part of the project. The keystone. The closet thing to it in real life is the tokamok reactor, a torus shaped magnetic confinement
plasma based fusion reactor: The problem, it takes more energy to run this thing than it outputs, and its the man body is over 30 meters across.
I could still try to build a fusion reactor, but the problem is that it costs billions of dollars. and is over 30 feet across. Ginormous. So I need to figure out a power 
source that is small and can fit in each individual piece of the armor for the mark 42 type deployment.
