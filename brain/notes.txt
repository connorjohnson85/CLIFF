An attempt to grant a computer a fully functioning general level intelligence type AI. 
Ideas on how it could work:

Sub nodify all processes, creating an inter connected web of nodes that share together and can change at will
Plausable.

Pros     |     Cons
smart    |     Very time consuming

The nueron is a very simple structure. However, with billions of them, are brains are the most complex machines out there... 
considering the popular view of a nueron, that is, a dendrite(sender) with a long axon(reciever) connection, I believe it would theoritaclly be
possible to create a smart machine using billions of interconnected nodes sending binary on and off signals to eachother, setting things into motion
to create the first general level AI.

Test1:
  3 connections each
