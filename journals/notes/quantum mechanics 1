The beggining of my quantum mechanics notes: Need for the reactor

quantum mechanics was discovered to apply when classical physics fail us
one example of such is the stern-gerlach experiment. 

The basic particles of quantum mechanics is based on really small things. The table goes like physics

x filter and y filters think of a polarizing lens...

energy of photon = h(plancks constant)/wavelength of the photon

Ephoton = 
KE = Ephoton - Energy required to release the energy = work function

spin of the electron creates much of the phenoma, if not all for such effects has magnetism and electricity
